/*
* To define a dynamic refence, you have to use a function, like malloc, calloc, realloc.
* On some systems other functions, like valloc, kmalloc, aligned_malloc(C 11), dlmalloc, ...
* can also be used, however, mostly malloc is in use.
*
* Each of these functions returns void*. It looks like a "dynamic pointer", however, that's
* wrong. The type void* is a typeless pointer and it must refer to an object. The function
* itself returns a reference on which memory the amount of required bytes has been created
* to work with our object.
*
* Attention: Every allocated memory MUST be released by your own, before the application is going to terminate,
* otherwise memory leaks appears. In some cases it MAY ALSO AFFECT your whole machine!
*
* A memory leak is a block of n bytes, which is still available, but no pointer refers to this block.
* On a normal application termination every allocated memory is automatically released, however,
* it an abnormal application termination is in use or on application runtime itself
* it will "break your neck", when you don't mind that.
*
* There're different ways to allocate memory:
* -	malloc		(C/C++)
* -	calloc		(C/C++)
* -	realloc		(C/C++)
* -	valloc		(C/C++; may work, but it's not a guarantee)
* -	new			(C++ only)
*
* attention:
* - unlike to C, in C++ you MUST cast it to your specified data type, because every function (except new) returns void*
*
* there're two ways to releasing allocated memory:
* -	free		(C/C++)
* -	delete		(C++ only)
*
* fun fact:
* In C++ you might use new to allocate memory and use the C-function free()
* to release this memory, as well as, by using malloc() to allocate and
* delete to remove this allocated memory. But that's not recommented.
*
* ------------------------------
* >>	Allocate memory of n bytes. It returns an address, where n bytes are now
* >>	available, however, your variable(s), struct(s), field(s) contains
* >>	garbage and must be initialized later
* void *malloc(size_t __size);
*
* ------------------------------
* >>	Acts like malloc, however, your object is initialized with a
* >>	default value, depending on the data type:
* >>	- int, short, long, float, double = 0(.0(F))
* >>	- char = '\0'
* >>	- C-string = "\0\0...\0"
* >>	- pointer(s) = NULL
*
* >>	argument #0: how many times an object needs to be allocated
* >>	argument #1: the amount of bytes for each object
* void *calloc(size_t __nmemb, size_t __size);
*
* ------------------------------
* >>	Reallocating more memory for an already allocated pointer.
* >>	It can also be used to allocate memory for the first time.
* >>	argument #0: pointer to use (can be NULL / nullptr in C++)
* >>	argument #1: additional amount of bytes
* void *realloc(void *__ptr, size_t __size);
*
* ------------------------------
* >>	MAY work like malloc/calloc/realloc, may also cause
* >>	an error on compile or runtime. => Hardly used.
* void *valloc(size_t __size);
*
* ------------------------------
* >>	releasing memory in C/C++:
* void free(void* __ptr);
*
* ATTENTION:
* __ptr MUST be allocated by malloc, calloc, realloc (valloc), ... before,
* otherwise a segmentation fault occurs
*
* often misunderstood:
* By using a pointer it doesn't mean, that this is always going to store on the heap.
* Even the stack can also hold pointers, however, it depends on if the pointer
* has a fixed size or a dynamically size during the runime. So, if you're using
* a pointer with a fixed size, this is often stored on the stack and by
* using a function like free() or delete expression in C++ an undefined behavior,
* or segmentation fault occurs.
*
* ------------------------------
* >>	releasing memory in C++ only:
* delete ptr;
*
* hint (for C and C++):
* Even your pointer has been successfully freed/deleted from memory, your pointer
* STILL EXISTS to that address, which has been used before! But by using the pointer
* after free()/delete, you'll get a segmentation fault, because this address is no
* longer assigned to that pointer. Assigning with NULL (C) / nullptr (C++) helps you
* define this pointer as invalid.
*
* There're also programs, which helps you to reveal potentially memory leaks in your
* application. On Linux you can use the program "valgrind". Other applications, like
* DrMemory, PVS studio, ... are also very useful!
