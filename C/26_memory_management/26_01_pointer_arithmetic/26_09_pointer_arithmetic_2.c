	* explanation:
	*
	* Have you expected to see:
	* 0 (array[0] = 0)
	* 1 (array[1] = 1)
	* 2 (array[2] = 2)
	* 3 (array[3] = 3) ?
	*
	* Well, now you know, you were wrong!
	*
	* Since ptr is a c-string the next value of ptr (ptr++) doesn't
	* contain 1, because ptr++ walks only 1 byte! array is int, thus
	* you're walking to the next byte of 4 bytes and trying to figure
	* out which value MAY return.
	*
	* On every 4th step you might see the expected value, however,
	* it's not clearly known, which values also returns.
