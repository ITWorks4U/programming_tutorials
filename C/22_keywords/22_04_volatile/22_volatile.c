/*
* The volatile keyword is a qualifier that is applied to
* a variable when it's declared. It tells the compiler
* that the value of the variable may change at any time.
*
* Without any action being taken by the code the compiler
* finds nearby. The implications of this are quite serious.
*
* However, a variable should be declared volatile whenever it's
* value could change unexpectedly. In practice, only three types of cases could appear:
* -	memory mapped peripheral registers
* -	global variables modified by an interrupt service routine (demonstraded here)
* -	global variables accessed by multiple tasks within a multi-threaded application
*
* To receive the signal, compile your application without optimizations,
* in that case with -O(1,2,3,...) flag.
*
* To see the difference, try to compile your application without
* the volatile keyword, but WITH -O flag. In that case you'll
* receive your signal, however, your infinite loop is still
* available and you'll never see the end of your application,
* unless you'll kill your current process.
