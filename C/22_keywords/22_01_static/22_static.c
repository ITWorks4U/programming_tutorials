* The static keyword in C is a storage-class specifier.

* Inside a function it makes a variable to retain it's value
* between multiple function calls.
*
* Outside of a function it retains the visibility of the
* function or variable to the current file only.
*
* By the way, a function is usually available from outside,
* unless you declare that function as static, too.
