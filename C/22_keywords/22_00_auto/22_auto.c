/*
* In C the keyword 'auto' has become obsolete and it's hardly used.
*
* It's still available for the previous programming language 'B' and
* it's useful for backward compability.
*
* Every variable, data type etc. with the keyword 'auto'
* specifies a storage duration. When you create an auto
* variable it has an "automatic storage duration".
*
* It's the same as "local variables", where in C all
* variables in functions are local by default.
*
* Attention: Unlike in C++ in C auto doesn't support
* an "anonymous" variable, like auto value = 123 or else,
* because this won't work. Your compiler gives you a
* warning followed by a suggestion, that this value is
* >>always<< interpreted as an integer.
*
* May also cause an undefined behavior!
