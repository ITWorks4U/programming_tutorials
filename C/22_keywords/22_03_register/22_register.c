/*
* In C the keyword 'register' sugggests to the
* compiler that the current variable should be
* stored into a CPU register, rather than into
* the memory.
*
* Each variable, which is successfully stored
* on a CPU register can be much faster accessed
* than on the memory, however, it depends on
* the compiler, if this variable CAN be stored
* on a CPU register or not, moreover, this
* variable can't be requested by using an
* address operator format. It will cause an error
* on compile time.
*
* On modern compilers the register keyword became obsolete.
* When does it makes sense to use register keyword?
* - a particular variable will be heavily used on runtime,
*   which may slow down the performance, when the variable
*   is stored to the RAM instead of to a CPU register
* - when you're working on an embedded system (any micro controller)
*   or a (very) old system
*
* Finally, the register is a storage class specifier.
* We can't use more than one storage class
* for a register variable, like:
* - register static int number;
* - register auto int number;
* - register extern int number;
