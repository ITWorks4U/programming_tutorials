/*
* Similar to sub processes threads allows you to work with many parallel tasks,
* because each CPU core can do a single action to speed up your application,
* however, using threads are tricky and may also cause an undefined behavior or,
* worse, a deadlock.
*
* On Windows you can't use POSIX threads by default. In that case you have to do
* an alternative way.
*
* This sample, however, doesn't comes with any threading.
*
* Remember: by using UNIX/Linux/... you should use -lm to tell the compiler to
* work with math functions and math objects. On Windows this is not required.
