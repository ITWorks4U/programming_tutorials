* With scanf() you're able to read any input from keyboard, however, you should
* know which input refers to which variable. By detecting a space bar the previously read text
* has been stopped. The text left is stored to the input buffer, which will be automatically
* used for the next input.
*
* So if you're using a text with two or more words, then this function doesn't handle your input well.
*
* By the way, almost every function, which reads from a file stream has not a clear
* limitation for the input buffer. Use your mind to figure out, when a buffer has
* reached its limit!
