/*
*
* Structures (struct) are very often used to capsulate
* multiple expressions to one object. Similar to OOP languages,
* however, the C programming is not mentioned to use for OOP.
*
* A structure often has a larger amount of bytes, because
* every member requires it's own free space.
*
* --------------------------------
* basic syntax of a struct:
* struct <name> {};
*
* you can also use a synonym for your structure, like:
* struct <name> {}<name_to_use>;
*
* you can also use an anonymous structure, like:
* struct {};
*
* in contrast to C++ when you want to use a structure, you must write:
* struct <name_of_struct> <name_of_instance>;
* => then you can use your structure and an access to its member(s)
*
* if you want to use a syntax like C++, Java, C#, Python, ... just write:
* typedef struct {}<any_expression>;
* => then you can use: <any_expression> <name_of_instance>;
* --------------------------------
*
* By the way, C handles a structure different rather than C++.
*
* C:
* - a struct contains members only
* - every member is unable to initialize inside of the struct
* - even a function can be wrapped into a struct to "claim", that
*   this function refers to that structure, but this is a bit tricky
*
* C++:
* - may initialize up to one member (any member)
* - may contain functions, constructor, destructor, ...
*  - those functions are called "methods", even there are not in a class
