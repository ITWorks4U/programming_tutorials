#   C / C++ header files
-   header files are similar to interfaces, where those are not interfaces for OOP
    -   these offers data types, definitions, functions, etc.
-   define anything in a header file and use this in the source file(s) without define those types multiple times
    -   attention: don't mix C and C++, when the header file shall be used in the C programming only
