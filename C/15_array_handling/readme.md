-   arrays can store a fixed amount of elements for a certain data type
    -   sometimes an array may looks like a pointer, but this shall never be handled like a pointer
    -   this leads to an undefined behavior
        -   also exists in C++
-   by passing an array into a function, then you'll be very surprised
