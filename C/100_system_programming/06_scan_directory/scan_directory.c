/*
* System programming in C.
*
* Scan a folder recursively from any start path.
* This sample works for Windows, as well as, UNIX.
*
* NOTE: Depending on which path you're starting the amount of
*       used memory could be high or not all data can be displayed,
*       because every detected sub folder is also going to scan.
*
* NOTE: Typically a file can also be displayed as: "-|d|c|b|p|l|srwxrwxrwx",
*       however, on a Windows machine this is hard to display, unless using
*       Windows API with too much complexity and possibly limited informations.
*       In summary, such a display can be provided on an UNIX system only.
*       See: unix_only/scan_[relative|absolute]_path.c
