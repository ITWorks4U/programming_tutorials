/*
* This source file doesn't contain a complex structure.
* The focus lies on the makefile itself.
*
* Usually a makefile can be used on Linux, macOS only.
* Mingw (for Windows), MAY be able to use a makefile, too, but
* this is not a clean statement.
*
* for linux / macOS: By default, the command "make" is already installed
* on your system. If you're not sure, type: whereis make
* if a path returns, then make was found, otherwise install make on your machine:
* sudo apt install make
*
* for Windows: if you're able to use a makefile by mingw, be happy :o)
* otherwise a batch file and also a powershell file exists for your own
* purpose
