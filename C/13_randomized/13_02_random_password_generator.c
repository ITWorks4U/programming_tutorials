/*
* Do you need a new password and you're tired to use an already, perhaps not good application?
* Then create your own application instead. ;-)
*
* - This application is written in C only.
* - It also works with C++.
* - tested with Linux (Mint 21.1), Raspberry OS Lite, Windows
*
* Have fun! :)
*
* PS:
* - macros were handled in chapter 17, but these are also implemented here
