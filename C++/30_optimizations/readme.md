#   Code optimization
-   even C++ is really fast, a tiny logical error may cause huge performance problems
    -   using a raw recursion instead of using a loop
    -   if a recursion is really required, then already calculated steps may be calculated over and over again
        -   see: fiboncacci series, factorial, gcd, ...
    -   determine the prime numbers without using a sieve
    -   using an iteration wrong
    -   ...
