#   first written application

-   simple to use without care of any side effects
    -   yeah, even in **C++** you can tap into the next pitfall ;-)

-   `cout`
    -   starts to print something out to the console
    -   in contrast to **C programming** you don't need a function like `prinf()`

-   `endl`
    -   ensures to jump to the next line after the printed output
    -   flushes the end stream
        -   advanced C++ programmers are often use a newline character `\n` instead
