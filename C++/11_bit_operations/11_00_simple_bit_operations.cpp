	* ^ => bitwise xor

	* You can also use expressions, like bitand, bitor, xor, compl, but
	* those are hardly used and those does not often result the identical
	* result, because you must combine those with additional brackets.
	* Furthermore your brackets must be placed correctly, otherwise the
	* result(s) is(are) difficult to the expected result!
	*
	* Don't mix bitwise and or bitwise or with && or ||, because these are logical operators.
	* Don't also mix expressions, like "and", "or", "not" => Those are also logical operators!
