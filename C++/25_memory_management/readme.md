#	memory management

-   it may happen, that you need resource(s) to handle something, like:
    -   offering a buffer
    -   working with (raw) pointers
    -   ...

-   in C++ you *may* work with (raw) pointers, but this causes an undefined behavior
    -   if you **really** must use pointers, then use `smart_pointers`

-   this section, however, doesn't shows you an example, because it's identical to C programming
    -   take a look to: [memory management in C](https://github.com/ITWorks4U/programming_tutorials/tree/main/C/26_memory_management)
