#	How to use Macros

-   macros, often used in C programming, are a powerful tool to define:
    -   constant expressions
    -   functions
    -   preprocessing instructions

-   however, macros are typeless and also offers you a bunch of pitfalls, if you don't mind
-   this section, however, doesn't shows you an example, because it's identical to C programming
