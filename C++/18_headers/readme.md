#	How to use Headers

-   header files (`*.h` (for C) / `*.hpp` (for C++, but rarley used)) allows you to define a basic "interface" for:
    -   functions
    -   data structures
    -   macros
    -   constants
    -   ...

-   the implementation(s) is(are) in splitted in (an)other source file(s) to gain a clean code style
-   this section, however, doesn't shows you an example, because it's identical to C programming
    -   take a look to: [header files in C](https://github.com/ITWorks4U/programming_tutorials/tree/main/C/18_headers)
