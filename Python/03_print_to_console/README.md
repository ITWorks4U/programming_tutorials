#   Print to the console
-   "just" use `print()` function

####    What can be printed?
-   everything you want (and don't want to see, if you don't mind)

####    formatting output
-   there are different ways to do this:
    -   use the C-like syntax (see: `03_01_print_c_style`)
    -   use the Java / C#-like syntax (see: `03_02_print_java_c_sharp_style`)
    -   use the Python-syntax (see: `03_03_pythonic_print`)

######	attention
-   __EVERYTING__ will be "a word" when it's printed to the console or written into a file
