#   Polymorphism

-   allows you to use the base class itself and use one of its derived class methods to work with
    -   however, in Python this is a bit strange, especially when you know other OOP languages, like C++, Java, C#, ...


### different types for polymorphism
-   compile-time polymorphism
-   runtime polymorphism (overriding)
    -   often known as `duck typing polymorphism`
        -   by calling a function with the base class as an argument
        -   by looping trough all instances
-   built-in functions
-   operator polymorphism

######  in summary:
>   Polymorphism is usually in use in OOP, but Python also allows to use this outside of OOP.
