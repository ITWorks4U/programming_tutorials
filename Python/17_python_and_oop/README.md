#   OOP in Python

-   offers to store multiple objects into one cluster / container
-   allows to use an object indepented to an another object

#####   points of interests:
-   this guideline contains four sections for OOP in Python:
    1)  the basics for a class structure including pitfalls
        -   default definition of a class
        -   what are properties (getter / setter / deleter)
        -   constructor / destructor
        -   instance method(s)
        -   class method(s)
        -   static method(s)
    2)  inheritance of classes
        -   extend a basic class with new properties
        -   learn about abstact classes
            -   those are identical to an interface
        -   learn the "diamond problem"
        -   enumerations
    3)  polymorphism
        -   runtime polymorphism (also known was "duck type")
        -   instance polymorphism
        -   compile time polymorphism
        -   built-in polymorphism
        - operator polymorphism
    4)  additional features
        -   dunder methods
        -   mehtod overloding with `singledispatch module`
        -   method overloading with `multipledispatch module`
        -   dataclasses
        -   singleton class
        -   factory class
