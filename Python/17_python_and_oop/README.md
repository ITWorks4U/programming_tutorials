#   OOP in Python

-   contains classes
    -   a class is a data structure, which holds anything
        -   constructor
        -   destructor (hardly self defined)
        -   class functions => methods
        -   class attributes
        -   ...

-   inheritance
-   enumerations
-   abstract class and interface
-   polymorphism
-   ...

### accessing to a class
-   creating an object instance to the class
    -   usual way
-   accessing to static methods
    -   by using specific modules and decorators

####    differences between other OOP languages
-   all members are **public** by default
    -   similar to a `struct` in C++ / C#
-   Python does **not** comes with `protected` or `private` sections
    -   those are often marked with: `_name` for any *name*
    -   sometimes, a "private" member is marked with: `__name` for any name
