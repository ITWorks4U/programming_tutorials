# ---
# Constructors allows you to let create an instance
# of the class itself.
# 
# there are multiple ways to use a constructor:
# - empty default constructor (exists by default)
# - custom default constructor (without arguments by yourself)
# - custom parameterized constructor (any arguments by yourself)
# 
# In Python only ONE constructor can exist!
#
# in contrast to C++, Java, C#:
# - Python does not support multiple constructors
# - Python does not support method overload (even for constructors)
#   - unless a module, like singledispatch or multipledispatch may help out
#
#   The last defined constructor / method dominates and the Python interpreter
#   starts to complain, when a constructor / method with the wrong number of
#   arguments is/are given.
# - a constructor is defined with __init__(self, ...)
#
# a destructor is also different rather to C++, Java, C#
# - defined with __del__(self)
# - hardly used; only in use, for:
#   - critical operations, e. g.: memory management
#   - if the context manager (with) can't be used
#   - when Python's garbage collector can't safety handle this
#
# a destructor should also NOT used in every situation, like:
# - unpredictable timing: when you donâ€™t know when __del__() will be called
# - unpredictable application run:
#   - program exits abruptly
#   - a circular reference may exist
# - can be interfere with garbage collection
# - exceptions in a __del__ are hard to debug and ignored by default
