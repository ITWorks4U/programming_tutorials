#   Programming tutorials

-   offers different languages for almost every system
-   it's a combination of all used sub repositories as an own repository to offer you a bunch of languages
    -   the certain repositories are now private and will be removed in the future
-   the most of the tutorials were rewritten and refreshed to make sure to work on (almost) every system, depending on the language itself

| bash / shell | Linux (perhaps also for macOS) |
| C | Windows, Linux, macOS |
| C++ | Windows, Linux, macOS |
